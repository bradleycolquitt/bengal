<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays the alignment of California Condor (<EM>Gymnogyps 
californianus</EM>) transcripts (sequenced using 454 high-throughput DNA 
sequencing) to the chicken genome.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Condor read sequences were obtained from the NCBI 
       <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi" TARGET=_BLANK>
       Trace Archives</A>: 
       CENTER_NAME=WUGSC, CENTER_PROJECT=U_FC-MATT_TECHD2.  The mean read size 
       is 110 bases.
    <li>The Condor reads were aligned to a set of predicted transcript 
      sequences, then the read was projected to transcript alignments on the 
      genome using the predicted transcript alignments.  This process improves
      alignments across splice sites.
      <ul>
        <li>Build a set of predicted transcripts sequences using PASA cluster 
            of chicken mRNA and EST BLAT alignments and N-SCAN gene predictions.
        <li>Align Condor reads to transcripts using LASTZ.
        <li>Project alignments onto the chicken genome.
        <li>Filter alignments to remove duplicate alignments and small 
            fragments, keeping those that score within one percent of the 
            best alignment for a given read.
      </ul>
    <li>Align reads that could not be mapped via the predicted transcript 
        directly to the chicken genome using LASTZ, and filter using the above 
        criteria.
  </ul>

<p>After performing the above steps, the resulting number of sequences and 
alignments of those sequences are summarized in this table:<BR>
<table class="transMap">
  <tr><th>          <th>&nbsp; sequences<th>&nbsp; alignments</tr>
  <tr><th>&nbsp; 454 reads <td>   419,240<td>           </tr>
